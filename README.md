# dynamic-thermalization
Emulating thermal observables on a digital quantum computer is essential for quantum simulation. We show that thermal observables and fluctuations may be obtained for a small closed system without a thermal bath. Thermal observables occur upon classically averaging quantum mechanical observables over randomized variants of their time evolution.
