# dynamic-thermalization
This is the research code by Nikolay Gnezdilov, which tests thermalization in a few-qubit system, calculating exact dynamics. The thermal observables/fluctuations emerge at the averaging of a dynamical quantum mechanical observable over randomized variants of its unitary evolution under a Hamiltonian that falls into a class of Gaussian unitary ensemble of random matrix theory. The energy of the initial state determines the resulting temperature.
This code was used for the exact dynamics. The results are published in Communications Physics 8 (1), 95 (2025) by H. Perrin, T. Scoquart, A. I.Pavlov, and N. V. Gnezdilov. The experimental data (raw and processed) from the quantum computer is available on the Zenodo repository: https://zenodo.org/records/14639657.
